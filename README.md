# HamOverEthernet
Convert BiTx or make stuff from scratch that is for QRP which has ethernet for control signals (tuning,band,etc) and Audio Signal over ethernet, however the radio being controlled is analog for TX and RX
Keep life simple and eliminate RF cables that have to run over 80feet!
Project is inspired from the fact that I live of the ground floor of 7 floored building with terrace as high as 80feet!
cant afford long RF cables.
